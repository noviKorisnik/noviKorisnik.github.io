# About

This application transforms AI-assisted development sessions into structured, readable books.

What began as a personal experiment—documenting the creation of the app itself using conversational AI—evolved into a repeatable workflow for reflecting on technical work, organizing thoughts, and preserving the story of building software.

## A Method for Turning Conversations into Books

At its core, this project blends human intent and AI collaboration. Each session begins as a dialogue—between a developer and an AI agent. From that conversation, structured components are derived: session analyses, book outlines, introductions and conclusions, and eventually a fully composed narrative artifact.

The system supports session upload, parsing, duplicate detection, and progressive analysis. Markdown is the medium; AI is the co-writer; the developer remains the orchestrator.

## The First Book: A Conversation in Chapters

The first book captured the journey of developing this very application. It was more than documentation—it was a reflection. Guided by Cody (Sourcegraph’s AI assistant) and shaped through custom prompts, the sessions were turned into parts and chapters with meaningful structure and editorial voice.

## The Sequel: *Ex Life Theater*

The second book, titled *Ex Life Theater*, continues the story—both narratively and technically. It captures the final wave of development sessions, culminating in a unique epilogue: a farewell interaction with Cody just before its sunset.

This sequel embraces the idea that software development can be theatrical: unfolding in acts, full of retrospection, improv, and emotion. In this "meta-development" approach, the application builds itself while writing about its own building process.

> *“The most enduring code is not just functional, but meaningful.  
> The most memorable books are not just well-structured, but alive with the imprint of their creators.”*  
> — Cody, final curtain message

## Internal Use

What began as a personal workflow found purpose inside a company as well. Using the same methodology, six internal books were generated from AI-assisted work sessions, demonstrating the approach’s value for documenting team-based technical knowledge.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeORM, SQLite, MongoDB
- **AI Providers**: Cody (Sourcegraph), Cohere
