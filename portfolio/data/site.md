Welcome to my portfolio.  

Here you will find an overview of my professional journey, spanning **long-term enterprise projects**, **core system design**, and **personal explorations** in software development.  

The structure follows several main groups:  

- **Personal Projects** — independent ideas and experiments, including AI-assisted tools.  
- **PaySpot** — financial technology applications and supporting ecosystem.  
- **Banking (Crédit Agricole)** — 14 years of enterprise development, foundational to much of my later work.  
- **Miscellaneous** — smaller projects and early experiments.  

Each section includes **summaries, technical focus points, and selected highlights** to give a clear picture of my experience.
