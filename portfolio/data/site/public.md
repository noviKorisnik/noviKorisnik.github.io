TBD - 'personal projects' does not seems as interesting phrase, need something more unique, catchy.

As my work for a long period is scoped to internal or limited access projects, can't share direct feel of products... so I decided to provide some more shareable items, now as personal projects presented within this section.

Outside of my professional career, I enjoy creating **independent projects** that let me explore new technologies, test architectural ideas, and present concepts in a more experimental way.  

These projects are often driven by curiosity â€” to see how far a concept can be pushed, or to solve a problem in a way that feels both elegant and practical.  

They also serve as a **public-facing portfolio**, allowing me to share my approach to software design and development, while experimenting with presentation, usability, and adaptability.
