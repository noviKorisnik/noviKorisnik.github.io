**PaySpot** is a leading provider of payment and financial processing solutions in Serbia, with expanding operations in Montenegro and North Macedonia.  

During my time at PaySpot, I played a central role in designing and developing key applications and the underlying .NET ecosystem. My focus shifted from feature development in early projects to **core architecture, scalability, and shared services**, enabling sustainable growth as the company expanded its development team and product offerings.  

### Core Contributions

- **PaymI** – Initial flagship payment application. I contributed to core development, a custom database access layer, and long-term feature growth.  
- **PaymI2** – A complete redesign and modernization effort, where I led frontend architecture (Angular) and supported backend modularization. This system now powers financial operations across multiple markets.  
- **Background Worker** – A Windows service built with Quartz for scheduled and automated tasks, such as delayed bank order submissions and status checks.  
- **MultiDb** – A specialized synchronization tool ensuring consistent configuration and access models across environments and markets.  
- **.NET Library Ecosystem** – A shared foundation of reusable modules for database access, authentication, financial services, reporting, and external integrations.  
- **Scrummy** - An internal tool created to improve team’s **Scrum-based development flow**.

### Regional Impact
With these applications, PaySpot established a **reliable financial backbone** for its services in Serbia and successfully expanded to Montenegro, with North Macedonia currently in rollout.
