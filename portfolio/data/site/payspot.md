*My Career • Financial Software • Platform Evolution*

## My Contributions at PaySpot

Since its inception, I have played a central role in designing and developing key applications and the underlying .NET ecosystem at **PaySpot**, a leading provider of payment and financial processing solutions with expanding operations in Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia.

My journey at PaySpot evolved significantly. Initially, my focus centered on core feature development for early projects. However, as the company expanded its development team and product offerings, my expertise shifted towards **core architecture, scalability, and the creation of shared services**. This strategic focus was instrumental in enabling the sustainable growth of our platform. Through these contributions, I helped build robust and maintainable systems that underpin PaySpot's financial operations across multiple markets.

### Regional Impact

Through the applications and foundational systems I helped design and build, PaySpot established a **reliable financial backbone** for its services in Serbia and successfully expanded to Montenegro, with North Macedonia currently in rollout. My work directly supported this regional growth and the continued operational excellence of our services.
