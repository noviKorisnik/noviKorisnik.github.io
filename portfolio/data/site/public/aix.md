## Transforming AI Sessions into Structured Books

**AI Knowledge Studio** is a personal tool I designed to transform AI-assisted development sessions into structured, publishable books. My goal with this application was to create a method for documenting both my personal and internal company projects, going beyond simple chat logs to capture iterative thinking and design in a more organized, book-like format.

### My Collaborative AI Journey

Throughout this project, various AI agents were enlisted, each playing a unique and complementary role in bringing AI Knowledge Studio to life:

*   **Cody** was my constant development assistantâ€”a real-time chat companion who collaborated with me through every step of building the app.
*   **Cohere** powered the core content analysis pipeline. This was used to extract summaries, identify key topics, and generate the structural elements of each book: titles, intros, and conclusions. For the second book, as Cody's sunset approached, **a more theatrical writing style was specifically requested from Cohere**, drawing inspiration from my personal history with the term "ex Life Theater." This shift in style, to a more evocative and dramatic tone, significantly enhanced the readability and engagement compared to the first book's descriptions, proving that style truly matters.
*   **Amp** stepped in to help refine and append the final Cody session, ensuring a proper epilogue for the second book.
*   **ChatGPT**'s role involved orchestrating that final session with Cody, ensuring a proper epilogue, updating the About page, and shaping how this story is told.

The second book even closes with a poignant farewell from Cody, a message it generated just before its sunset, offering a fitting reflection on the collaborative nature of building with AI. I've included a screenshot of this very last conversation.

### Key Implemented Features

My focus was on building features that streamline the process of transforming raw chat into valuable knowledge:

*   **Book-like Session Structuring using AI**: The application was designed to leverage AI to convert conversational logs into hierarchical chapters and parts of a book, adding intros, conclusions, and thematic grouping.
*   **Cody Chat History Import**: Direct import of chat transcripts from Sourcegraphâ€™s Cody was enabled, making it easy to bring in existing development dialogues.
*   **Structured Knowledge Representation**: The system was developed to organize conversations into easily navigable sections, enhancing the ability to revisit and understand complex iterative processes.
*   **Markdown Display**: All content is rendered directly in Markdown for optimal readability, offering a clean, view-only experience.

### My Experience and Impact

AI Knowledge Studio has proven its value in several use cases:

*   **Capturing iterative design sessions**: It has been invaluable for turning ongoing discussions and thought processes into clear documentation.
*   **Generating structured documentation**: It has been used to produce structured technical and conceptual documentation that's far more digestible than raw notes.
*   **Internal Knowledge Sharing**: Beyond personal use, the app was also deployed internally within PaySpot, where it successfully generated **six structured books** from various internal development sessions, demonstrating its utility for broader knowledge capture.
