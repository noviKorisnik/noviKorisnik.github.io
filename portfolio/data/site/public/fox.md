## AI-Generated Comic

I embarked on a small, creative experiment to explore the capabilities of AI in visual storytelling. My goal was to create a short graphic novel, or comic, illustrating a scene from Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry's "The Little Prince," specifically focusing on the poignant encounter with the Fox.

### My Creative AI-Assisted Process

The journey began with **ChatGPT**, where I initiated an investigation into how AI image generation could be leveraged for comic creation. Through iterative prompting and detailed guidance, I developed an **8-panel story** that aimed to capture the essence of the original narrative.

A critical aspect of this experiment was **guiding the AI to replicate the original illustration style** from "The Little Prince" while also dictating the **storytelling orientation of individual panels**. This involved carefully crafting prompts to ensure visual consistency and narrative flow across the sequence.

The result is a fully realized comic presented as a simple web page. I've designed it for a **responsive viewing experience**, featuring a two-page layout for wider screens and automatically switching to a single-page layout for narrower, mobile devices.

### Outcome & Insights

This project demonstrates how AI can be a powerful tool for visual creatives, not just for generating images, but for actively participating in the storytelling process when guided by a clear vision.
