PaymI was PaySpot’s first major financial application. It became the foundation for handling payment operations and related services across the company.

### Architecture

* Built on **.NET Framework**, with a custom **database access layer** since Entity Framework did not support DB2 at the time.
* Application core was designed in-house to ensure reliability and extensibility.

### Features

* Supported a wide range of **financial transaction workflows**.
* Included modules for user management, payment processing, and integrations with partner systems.
* Continually expanded through **feature-driven development** over several years.

### Business Impact

* Served as PaySpot’s primary operational system for financial services.
* Still in production today, though gradually being replaced by **PaymI2** as features are migrated.

### Role

I worked on both **core application development** and **new feature implementation**. My responsibilities also included maintaining architectural consistency and ensuring the system evolved reliably over time.
