*Core Financial Application • Architectural Redesign • Scalability*

## Architecting the Next Generation Financial Platform

**PaymI2** represents the next generation of PaySpot’s core financial application. I led its creation as a complete redesign of the earlier PaymI system. While the first version heavily prioritized features, my architectural vision for PaymI2 was fundamentally driven by long-term maintainability, scalability, and a clean, modular design.

### My Role & Core Architectural Focus

My main focus for PaymI2 was **core architecture**, rather than feature-specific development. I designed the comprehensive frontend structure, ensuring that new features could be added cleanly and efficiently by a growing development team. Simultaneously, I worked on significant backend improvements, specifically targeting enhanced modularity and code reuse.

### Frontend Architecture I Designed

The frontend was built with a strong emphasis on modularity and reactive patterns:

*   **Angular-based Development**: The application is built with **Angular**, fully modularized using a clear structure of shared and feature modules.
*   **Abstract Page Types**: I introduced abstract page types to cover common behaviors. This allows concrete pages to be defined generically, significantly minimizing custom code and boilerplate.
*   **Model-Based Feature Inheritance**: Features inherit functionality efficiently via **model-based roles**, which greatly reduces duplication across the application.
*   **Consistent Service Interface**: Shared services, such as entity and action services, provide a consistent and predictable interface for interacting with data and actions throughout the app.
*   **Reactive Data Handling**: I made heavy use of **RxJS** for reactive patterns, ensuring flexible and powerful data handling capabilities.
*   **Performance & Localization**: The architecture inherently supports **lazy loading** for optimized performance and includes robust **multi-language localization** out of the box.

### Backend Architecture I Improved

On the backend, my work focused on enhancing the core structure for better reusability:

*   **NET Core Foundation**: The backend is based on **.NET Core**.
*   **Strategic Restructuring**: I initiated key restructuring efforts to extract specialized logic into **shared libraries**. This made the core application lighter and more reusable, enabling parts of it to be leveraged by other products within PaySpot.

### Business Impact

PaymI2 has delivered substantial business value for PaySpot:

*   It successfully consolidates features from the original PaymI while simultaneously introducing new, advanced capabilities.
*   The application is currently deployed in **Serbia** and **Montenegro**, with an ongoing rollout to **North Macedonia**, solidifying its role across multiple markets.
*   PaymI2 serves as a cornerstone product for PaySpot’s financial operations, underpinning our services in diverse regions.
