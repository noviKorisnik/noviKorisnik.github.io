Not every project fits neatly into a single category. Over the years, I have worked on a range of smaller tools, experiments, and early career projects that helped shape my skills and way of thinking.  

Some of these were exploratory, others were practical, and a few simply fun side efforts. While they may not carry the same depth as larger professional or personal projects, they reflect the **breadth of experience** and willingness to approach problems from different angles.
