Passionate software developer with a love for clean architecture, thoughtful UI, and lifelong learning. I build things that work, scale, and feel good to use.

With a background in full-stack development and a keen interest in AI, I’ve worked across industries, teams, and stacks. When I'm not coding, I enjoy diving into creative writing or exploring design systems.
